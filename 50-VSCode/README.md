Just needs uncompressing the `.vscode.tbz` file and running 'x c' (execute config).

## Config

* Settings are in .vscode/settings.json.
* Better to avoid settings being in ~/.config/Code/User/settings.json (delete it).
* Start the app with "code ." or just 'e'
* If VSCode asks for kits, scan for them and select "Unspecified: let CMake select.."

## Usage

* Below, on the status bar, run with the right-pointing triangle
* Also, run with [CONTROL][F5]
* Format code with [CTRL][SHIFT][i]
* Snippets appear with [CTRL][SPACE]
* [CTRL][SHIFT][b] builds and runs using the tasks.json file and the `.x` script.
* [CTRL][p] opens the QuickOpen bar
